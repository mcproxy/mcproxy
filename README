Introduction
============
Mcproxy is an IGMP/MLD Proxy daemon for Linux.

IGMP/MLD proxies offer the possibility option to combine local 
multicast networks with a larger multicast infrastructure. In contrast 
to multicast routers, proxies are lightweight and do not require the 
support of a multicast routing protocol such as PIM or DVMRP. A 
common use case is a local stub networks that interconnects with a 
remote multicast routing domain, e.g. via a tunnel. Another usage 
example is in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6 - RFC 5213) domains that 
want to provide transparent multicast services for mobile nodes. The 
mcproxy meets the requirements of the IGMP/MLD proxy standard 
(RFC 4605) and has additional functionalities. The multicast proxy can 
be instantiated multiple times and is dynamically configurable at 
runtime.


Requirements
============
* To generate a makefile, qmake must be installed. This can be done with
the following command:
  
  newer systems: apt-get install qt5-qmake
  older systems: apt-get install qt4-qmake

* To build the mcproxy, the libraries boost_threat, boost_date_time and 
boost_system must be installed. This can be done with the following 
command:
  
  apt-get install libboost-all-dev

* To use the IPv6 functionality the kernel has to be configured and 
compiled with the experimental kernel feature <IPv6: multicast routing>.
For more Details go to chapter <Startup>.

* To use more then one proxy instance for IPv4 and IPv6 the kernel has
to  be configured and compiled with the experimental kernel feature
<IP: multicast policy routing> and <IPv6: multicast policy routing>. 
For more Details go to chapter <Startup>.

* To build the documentation, doxygen must be installed. This can be
done with the following command:

  apt-get install doxygen

* The mcproxy has to be started with root privileges.

* A Linux kernel version greater than version 2.6.32 is required.


Compilation
===========
Build mcproxy in release mode:

  cd mcproxy/
  qmake 
  make

Build mcproxy in debug mode:

  cd mcproxy/
  qmake CONFIG+=debug
  make


Installation
============
To copy mcproxy to the system directory, run (optional):

  make install


Documentation
=============
Mcproxy includes a HTML documentation. The documentation will 
be located in the docs/ directory after the execution of:

    make doc


Directories
===========
doxygen/    - Example code and graphics used in the Doxygen
                documentation
mcproxy/    - Makefile, Header and source code files of the mcproxy


Startup
=======
At first you should check the available kernel features of your
system. Type the following command:

    sudo mcproxy -c
   
If a kernel feature you need failed you have to reconfigure and
recompile your linux kernel. In the debug folder is a README file 
which could help you with this problem.

To run the mcproxy you need to create a valid configuration file.
There is an example in the project folder (mcproxy.conf).

* To run the mcproxy in the background type the following command:

    sudo nohup mcproxy -f <path/to/config_file> &

* To run the mcprocy with all available status and debug messages:

    sudo mcproxy -dsvv -f <path/to/config_file>

For more information see 'mcproxy -h' or visit our project page.
